# my_own_style_DRL_algorithms
Rewrite the DQN algorithms from pytorch official document code in my own style,and most of the original annotations are preserved.
Separate the DQN from main.py so it is easier to understand.
Add argparse to make it easy to test.
Add the function of saving and loading models.
